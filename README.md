# FPGA Interfacing

This project is a set of all the files and documentation of the FPGA project work that was carried out in WEL Laboratory - IIT Bombay during Summer 2016.

## Aim
* To build and program a circuit that uses a CPLD controller to divide computations between two FPGA chips.
* To program Altera CPLD chip using a microcontroller which emulates the Altera USB Blaster. This would allow direct programming from Quartus II without the hassles of external hardware requirements, UrJTAG and the need to create Serial Vector files.

A detailed documentation of the project can be found in FPGA.pdf
